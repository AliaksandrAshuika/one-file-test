### Amdahl's Law

[Amdahl's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)

As [Moore's Law](#moores-law) slows, and the acceleration of individual processor speed slows, parallelisation is key to improving performance. Graphics programming is an excellent example - with modern Shader based computing, individual pixels or fragments can be rendered in parallel - this is why modern graphics cards often have many thousands of processing cores (GPUs or Shader Units).
