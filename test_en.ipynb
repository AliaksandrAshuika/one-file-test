For a list of the Python features that you can use with AutoGraph, see [AutoGraph Capabilities and Limitations](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/g3doc/reference/limitations.md). For more details about `tf.function`, see the RFC [TF 2.0: Functions, not Sessions](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180918-functions-not-sessions-20.md).
