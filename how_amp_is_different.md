AMP Pages can use many PWA features on their own, as long as they're served from your origin (your site's domain) as opposed to an AMP Cache. This means that PWA features won't kick in when consuming an AMP Page within a platform like Google or Bing, but they will on the onward journey, or if users navigate to your AMP pages directly.

The `on` attribute is used to install event handlers on elements. The events that are supported depend on the element.

The value for the syntax is a simple domain-specific language of the form:

[sourcecode:javascript]
eventName:targetId[.methodName[(arg1=value, arg2=value)]][/sourcecode]

See the table below for descriptions of each part of the syntax.

The AMP Dev Channel release **may be less stable** and it may contain features not available to all users. Opt into this option if you'd like to help test new versions of AMP, report bugs or build documents that require a new feature that is not yet available to everyone.

Opting into Dev Channel is great to:

- test and play with new features not yet available to all users.
- use in quality assurance (QA) to ensure that your site is compatible with the next version of AMP.
