## Quotes from the teams
Of course we can't cover every change that has happened. So we reached out and
asked some of our teams what changes they are most proud of:

> For rustdoc, the big things were:
> * The automatically generated documentation for blanket implementations
> * The search itself and its optimizations (last one being to convert it into JSON)
> * The possibility to test more accurately doc code blocks "compile_fail,
>   should_panic, allow_fail"
> * Doc tests are now generated as their own seperate binaries.
>
> — Guillaume Gomez ([rustdoc])


> Rust now has baseline IDE support! Between IntelliJ Rust, RLS and
> rust-analyzer, I feel that most users should be able to find "not horrible"
> experience for their editor of choice. Five years ago, "writing Rust" meant
> using old school Vim/Emacs setup.
>
> — Aleksey Kladov ([IDEs and editors][ides])


> For me that would be: Adding first class support for popular embedded
> architectures and achieving a striving ecosystem to make micro controller
> development with Rust an easy and safe, yet fun experience.
>
> — Daniel Egger ([Embedded WG][ewg])


> The release team has only been around since (roughly) early 2018, but even in
> that time, we've landed ~40000 commits just in rust-lang/rust without any
> significant regressions in stable.
>
> Considering how quickly we're improving the compiler and standard libraries, I
> think that's really impressive (though of course the release team is not the
> sole contributor here). Overall, I've found that the release team has done an
> excellent job of managing to scale to the increasing traffic on issue
> trackers, PRs being filed, etc.
>
> — Mark Rousskov ([Release][release])
